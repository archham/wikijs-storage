### Introduction

Overleaf is a Software with that you can edit LaTeX files in a browser. This is a Tutorial on how to setup a self-hosted Overleaf Community Edition server on Linux.

It is intended that you **run** this **server** **behind a reverse proxy**. It is **very** **important** to do so **if** **you** plan to **publish** the **application** **to the internet!**

### Preparation

- Linux server
- ``git`` ``docker`` ``openssl``
- Reverse proxy (not included in this tutorial)

``` bash
# Get packages with the package manager of your distro

sudo dnf install git

## dnf RHEL based (RHEL, Rocky, Alma, Centos, etc.)
## apt Debian based (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, etc.)
## and so on

# add dedicated application user
adduser overleaf

# Be sure that your designated user is part of the docker group
## Give application user right for docker
usermod -aG docker overleaf

## Check it when you are logged in as overleaf - displays docker
groups
```

**<u>!Caution!</u>**

*When using RHEL based os for the server it is recomended to deinstall Podman and install Docker CE. Podman was not tested.*

**Installation successfully tested on the 19.07.2024**

``` bash
# Make a directory and cahnge the permissions
sudo mkdir /opt/overleaf-toolkit
sudo chown overleaf:root /opt/overleaf-toolkit

# change to application user
su - overleaf

## (OPTIONAL) set alias for easier access
echo "# alias for working dir" >> .bashrc
echo "alias cda='cd /opt/overleaf-toolkit/'" >> .bashrc
source .bashrc

# Download git repo to opt and cd into it
git clone https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit.git /opt/overleaf-toolkit
cd /opt/overleaf-toolkit

# initialize the project
./bin/init

## (OPTIONAL) change any variable needed in this directory
ls config
vi config/overleaf.rc

----------------START-----------------
# Gets reachable outside of the server. Do not use if you are using the provided TLS proxy.
## OVERLEAF_LISTEN_IP=127.0.0.1
OVERLEAF_LISTEN_IP=0.0.0.0

# Disable this because it is a Pro feature
## SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=true
SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=false

# Needed if logs should be written to the host
OVERLEAF_LOG_PATH=logs

----------------STOP------------------
## Note: we recommend that you re-create the docker containers after changing anything in `overleaf.rc` or `variables.env`, by running `bin/docker-compose down`, followed by `bin/up`
mkdir logs

# Add the http service to the local firewall
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all

# Test if you can start the application
## This takes some time
./bin/up

# Check if the website is reachable


# Stop the application if needed
./bin/stop
```

### Configuration

``` bash
# Make the application to a systemd service
vi /etc/systemd/system/overleaf.service

----------------START-----------------
[Unit]
Description=Overleaf Community Edition

[Service]
Type=oneshot
WorkingDirectory=/opt/overleaf-toolkit
ExecStart=/opt/overleaf-toolkit/bin/up -d
ExecStop=/opt/overleaf-toolkit/bin/stop
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----------------STOP------------------

# Reload the deamon, enable & start overleaf Service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable overleaf.service
systemctl start overleaf.service

# Check status of service
systemctl status overleaf.service
```

#### Tex Live full install {#tex_live_full_install}

By default Overleaf Community Edition installs LaTeX in a \"lite\" version. In order to use the full capabilities of Overleaf it is advised to fully install LaTex (all packages).

> *Remember, that once you update the image used for Overleaf you need to redo this step. Each time. That\'s CE Version for you :)*

``` bash
# Change in to working directory
cda

# Enter a shell into the container
./bin/shell

# Current container (6.1.2) still has TeX Live 2025 so no longer update. Change repo to historic
tlmgr option repository https://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/historic/systems/texlive/2025/tlnet-final

# Update TeX Live Manager
tlmgr update --self

## Display version of TeX Live
tlmgr --version
tlmgr revision 71331 (2024-05-24 09:30:36 +0200)
TeX Live (https://tug.org/texlive) version 2024

# Install full scheme (takes about 10 to 20 min)
tlmgr install scheme-full

# **Important**: From `3.3.0` release onwards running `tlmgr path add` is required again after every use of `tlmgr install`, in order to correctly symlink all the binaries into the system path.
tlmgr path add

# Exit container shell
exit
```
**OPTIONAL** - Saving your changes
The changes you've just made have changed the `sharelatex` container, but they are ephemeral --- they will be lost if Compose recreates the container, e.g. as part of updating the config.

To make them persistent, use `docker commit` to save the changes to a new docker image:

```
$ cat config/version
5.0.3
#^^^^ --------------- matching version ----------- |
#                                                vvvvv
$ docker commit sharelatex sharelatex/sharelatex:5.0.3-with-texlive-full

$ echo 5.0.3-with-texlive-full > config/version
```

After committing the changes, update the `config/version` accordingly. Then run `bin/up`, to recreate the container.

Note that you will need to repeat these steps when you upgrade (``./upgrading.md``).


### Update

``` bash
# Stop service
systemctl stop overleaf.service

# Change into working directory
cda

# Update
./bin/upgrade

# Stop automaticly started containers
./bin/stop

# Start service again
systemctl start overleaf.service
